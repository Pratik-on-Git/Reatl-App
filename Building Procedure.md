# Reatl — Reels-Style Food Ordering App
#### MERN app where users browse short food videos and order instantly. 
#### MVP: Reels feed, one-tap ordering, real-time order status.

### Reatl — Overview
Short vertical, fast-consumption UX like Reels/Shorts where users browse short food videos (or micro-ads) and can instantly order the dish shown. Emphasis: snackable discovery → 1-tap ordering.
